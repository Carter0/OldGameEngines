-- Who worked on this lab?
Carter Weinberg 



-- How many hours did it take you to complete this lab?
About 4-5


-- Describe your approach to implementing the lab.
I worked through the tutorials which helped a lot. I ran into an issue
where when I originally outputted the framerate before I capped it, the number would be 
very large and just keep counting up. 
This issue fixed itself when I capped the framerate.



-- Did you implement any extentions? If so, which ones and how can they be tried out?
Yeah, I did the one where the boxes change colors and speeds depending on the colors.


-- Did you use any code or resources from previous assignments? If so, list below.
Yeah, I used the render, rendertext, and cleanup functions from lab1.


-- Did you use any external resources? If so, cite them below.
Yes so there are the two linked tutorials and one youtube video I found.

-- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, list below.
No


-- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the lab?
Watching the boxes move on screen.


-- (Optional) How would you improve the lab?
I think its fine as is other than my issue with the framerate number.
