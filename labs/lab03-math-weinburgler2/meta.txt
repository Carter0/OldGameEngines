-- Who worked on this lab?
Carter Weinberg



-- How many hours did it take you to complete this lab?
6


-- Describe your approach to implementing the lab.
I first got the testing library working, then I wrote tests and functions/methods one at a time 
till I was done.


-- Did you implement any extentions? If so, which ones and how can they be tried out?
I wrote 4 more functions that I thought would be of use. They include two == operator overrides,
a sgrmagnitude function, and a lerp function.


-- Did you use any code or resources from previous assignments? If so, list below.
Nope.


-- Did you use any external resources? If so, cite them below.
Yeah, so I used

-- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, list below.
Nope.


-- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the lab?
Ehh, the coding was enjoyable.


-- (Optional) How would you improve the lab?
So, the way I did the matrix multiplication was a real pain. I get why we need to do it,
but dear god it was annoying. Maybe there was a better way, but I didn't know it.

Some parts of this lab also seemed a bit repetitive. But I am also not sure that should be changed.
