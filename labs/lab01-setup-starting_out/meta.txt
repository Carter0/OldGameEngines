-- Who worked on this lab?
Carter Weinberg and Megharth Lakhataria



-- How many hours did it take you to complete this lab?
About 6.



-- Describe your approach to implementing the lab.
I read through the tutorials for the first part. Not much to explain there.
For the second part, I basically just googled around until I found a youtube tutorial 
that described how to animate an image. 



-- Did you implement any extentions? If so, which ones and how can they be tried out?
Not quite sure what you mean by extention. But I don't think so. 


-- Did you use any code or resources from previous assignments? If so, list below.
Nope, this is the first lab.


-- Did you use any external resources? If so, cite them below.
Yeah, so obviously there is the sdl2 tutorial we need for the first part of the lab here https://www.willusher.io/pages/sdl2/.
Then I used these two youtube videos to help me animate my foreground:

-- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, list below.
Nope. 


-- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the lab?
Just learning how to use SDL in general was nice.  


-- (Optional) How would you improve the lab?
I really did not like getting this set up with Eclipse, so much so I gave up and decided to just use vscode without any extra bells and 
whistles like syntax highlighting or intellisense. 

Honestly, I think the class should just recommend vscode or vim cause I don't like eclipse and don't really see the point in using it.
