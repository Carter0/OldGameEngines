5


-- Describe your approach to implementing the lab.
I tried to do it first with a shared pointer, but quickly realized that was not the way.
Then I realized I could watch a video and see them explain how to use a map to do it, and did it that way.
I then fixed some bugs, and the rest wasn't too hard.


-- Did you implement any extentions? If so, which ones and how can they be tried out?
Yeah, I added all the frames to the animation.


-- Did you use any code or resources from previous assignments? If so, list below.
Nope. 


-- Did you use any external resources? If so, cite them below.
Nope. 


-- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, list below.
Yeah, I did collab with my groupmates for the project. I asked them for help a lot with my bugs and stuff.

Learning more about allocation.


-- (Optional) How would you improve the lab?
I think its fine as is.
